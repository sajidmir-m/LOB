PDP Issues,"Information shown about a product is incorrect, incomplete, or misleading on website/app

Examples of PDP issues:

– Variance in MRP

– Inaccurate product title 

– Inaccurate dimensions/ specifications

– Misleading product image

– Missing key details (e.g., ingredients, compatibility- if applicable)

– Features described do not match the actual product

– Images not helpful (Comparative Sizing Not Available, No Lifestyle Images)
","If the PDP title, images, and description matches the product, and another variant is available on Blinkit, treat it as an incorrect item received case and follow the Wrong Item Policy

Step 1: Always verify the image shared by the customer first, then compare it with the image given on PDP (Blinkit website). 
Step 2: Check if there is any mismatch in the product title/ image/ key features/ description
Step 3: For any mismatch found, provide the appropriate resolution to the customer, as the issue arises from the PDP, not the product.
